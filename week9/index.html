        <p class="section-body">
          This week, we focused on learning networking and web service integration with ESP32s.
          This aligned closely with what I want to work on for my final project, so I decided to
          integrate this week’s assignment directly into my smart door system.

          I wanted to integrate my door project with WiFi so I could control it from anywhere.
          The first hurdle was getting network access—Harvard requires device registration, so I had
          to manually register the ESP32’s MAC address before it could join the WiFi network. Once it
          was online, I created a Firebase backend to handle API-style communication between my phone
          and the device. I ran into issues with event triggers firing inconsistently and with
          validating security keys, but after restructuring the database rules everything stabilized.
          I also made a custom Apple Shortcut that writes a value to Firebase, which the ESP32
          continuously checks. As soon as the value updates, the device unlocks the door. I added the
          shortcut to my lock screen so I can open my door with a single tap. As long as I have an
          internet connection, I can now interact with my door from anywhere.

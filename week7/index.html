          For my output device, I used a stepper motor, but was interested in looking at serial periferal interfaces. For that, I decided to look at SD card readers. I had some issues with the SD card reader so I had to use an oscilloscope to check if the SPI was functioning. I saw packets being sent after hooking the clock up to one channel and the data pin up to another channel. Bobby was helpful during this debugging. Unfortunately I did not take a picture of this testing and left campus because of an illness such that I was not able to get a picture of this debugging. So, instead, here is a data packet from an oscilloscope taken at the EE learning labs looking at a very similar package-style data transmission that looked similar to the one I had used in the PS70 lab.

          For my MVP, I made the casing and a breadboard temporary version of my circuit. It has two imputs: a do not disturb switch which has a blinking light and a bathroom button to keep the door open when using the restroom. The stepper motor is powered by 12V and spools up the attached handle to theoretically unlock the door. All of the implemented features currently work. The next steps involve soldering all of the parts togehter, adding a BUC converter to make it so the device can be powered by only one 12V connection, testing to ensure the torque is enough to open my door, network interaction with Harvard’s wifi along with a webhook, and finally an attachment to my door. So far, though, I am happy with the progress that I have made and look forward to implementing the rest of the steps.

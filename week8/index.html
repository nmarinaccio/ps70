        <p class="section-body">
          This week I learned the flow for CNC work on the ShopBot: preparing stock, fixturing, setting XY and Z,
          and running toolpaths safely. It was a good reminder that CNC is as much about planning as it is about
          cutting. Post processing opens up a lot of finish options—sanding, edge breaks, stains, and oils—to take a
          rough cut to a presentable object. It also taught me to think about grain direction, tool geometry, and where
          tabs and ramps live so cleanup is fast and the parts still look sharp.

          I wanted to make a Christmas gift for my mom and she loves strange looking coasters so I decided to make them.
          I started in CAD to make sure they all fit together and to form the shapes. I then moved on to actually making them.
          I have yet to stain them, but I intend to do so before Christmas.

          I had some difficulty at first with the CAD as I knew they wouldn’t fit together if it was all one shape.
          Bobby helped me separate them by first making all the coasters their own 3D object before reverting back to 2D.

          Because this week was about post processing as well as CNCing, I wanted to make a silicone figit toy.
          I decided to make spikes as I thought they would feel funny. I started by 3D printing the negative
          and then cast the silicone into the negative. It worked pretty well.

        <p class="section-intro">
          This week’s assignment was to design and build a small kinetic sculpture using basic hand tools
          and laser-cut parts, then power it with simple circuitry (e.g., a DC motor and a supply). The goal
          is to explore mechanisms, motion, and assembly while practicing documentation of process and results.

          I started by collecting ideas that could translate into repeatable motion with simple parts and
          constraints. Below are three early directions I explored.

        <!-- 1.1 The Chairlift -->
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <h4 class="mini-title mt-16">The Chairlift</h4>
        <figure class="media-frame mt-8">

        </figure>
        <p class="section-body mt-16">
          When I first thought about a kinetic sculpture, I wanted to make something similar to a mechanism
          I need for my final project: a motor pulling tension on a door handle via line. That led to a spinning
          loop concept—combining sculpture with a ski-chairlift motif. But a few issues surfaced: preventing
          belt/line slip on the loop, maintaining an uphill incline, and fabricating a robust motor connector
          without 3D printing. Those risks made this path less attractive.
        </p>

        <!-- 1.2 The Moving Sidewalk -->
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <h4 class="mini-title mt-16">The Moving Sidewalk</h4>
        <figure class="media-frame mt-8">

        </figure>
        <p class="section-body mt-16">
          Next, I considered a wider belt with a textured surface to shuttle objects and “kick” them off an end stop.
          This would address slipping and incline issues, but the motor coupling—again without 3D-printed hubs—remained
          finicky. Doable, but not how I wanted to spend the week.
        </p>

        <!-- 1.3 The Dancing Tree -->

        </figure>
        <p class="section-body mt-16">
          After a very busy week, I pivoted to a decorative “dancing tree.” The idea was to get a simple,
          reliable motion working first—then layer on flair (figurines, ornaments) later. Function first, polish second.

              Starting with the CAD, I made concentric circles 40&nbsp;mm thick from the outside inward,
              with a 5&nbsp;mm center bore for the dowel. I then designed gear-shaped central holders
              (kept for aesthetics) and added arms for each level, rotated 90° between tiers.

              After cutting, I mounted the system on a 5.5&nbsp;mm dowel. A snug fit was achieved
              by reducing the hole slightly with cardboard. I cut a slit at the dowel base to mate with the
              motor’s output shape, then assembled the motor, arms, and dowel with careful spacing and hot glue.
              First test: success.

              The structure needed to support both the motor and rotating tree while clearing a dual-ended shaft.
              I built a two-chamber box: the top cradles the motor and provides through-slots for the axle; the
              bottom can house a future battery pack. Final touches included a zip tie for restraint and a centering
              slit to keep the tree aligned.

          Here’s the result. I only had time to paint stripes on one tier, and there’s room for more décor,
          but the motion works reliably! Next steps: switch to wood for stiffness, slightly widen the support arms,
          and add decorative elements. For a one-week build, I’m happy with how it turned out.

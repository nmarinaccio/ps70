        <h2 class="intro-title">Final Project Idea: The Dorm Smart Door</h2>
        <p class="intro-subtitle">
            For my final project, I want to turn my dorm room door into a smart door possibly using bluetooth, pistons to unlock the door, and web interfacing. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> I am a forgetful person. I have locked myself out of my dorm more times than I can remember. In Dunster house, we have to leave our dorm rooms to use the bathroom. On top of that, we are still using the antiquated system of lock and key. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Well for me, it is broke. I want to be able to go to the bathroom without worrying about locking myself out while also keeping my room and belongings safe.

            Using microcontrollers, pistons, other electronics, and other custom designed parts, I want to create a modular system to install electric door lock controls in my dorm room. With the addition of a microcontroller, many of these parts can be triggered by either bluetooth or internet access. Interfacing with a custom server, I would love to create a web app to control my door lock. This would allow me to not only unlock and lock my door from my phone, I would also be able to authroize friends to get access to my dorm at certain times without giving them unrestricted access to my room. Another idea is a combination lock system can be added to unlock the door. Finally, just by interfacing with the internal handle, using a key to enter is still entirely possible for any college officials who may need access to the dorm.

            I also want this to be modular and not perminant. The door cannot be damaged in this process so I will need to design a casing and possibly a custom attachment system that leaves the door unscathed. My roomate and I would also love to move this device to our dorm room next year, so it should be modular and easy to install. Overall, this would be a fun project that touches many different types of engineering and design while also solving a real world issue that I, embarrassingly, have encountered far too often.

          During freshman year, I lived in a suite in Canaday. We lived in the kind of suite that had a community
          around it. People who lived there and who didn’t live there made it their home and would come and go.
          Unfortunately we also had issues with break ins. I thought to myself that it could be amazing if only there
          was a way to make it so we could grant people timed access and unlock the door digitally. This would allow
          the people we want to come and go as they please without needing a key, but keeping the door locked. Two years
          later, as a junior, I still thought that concept was cool. I’ve never been a big key carrier and my roomate and
          I would always leave our key in our door. Earlier this year, our neighbor was broken into because they too left
          their key outside. With the support of PS-70, I decided that enough was enough, and, as “simple” (not really
          unfortunately) and common of a project it was, I wanted to make a smart dorm door to open from my phone. First
          I thought of two possible ideas for the door. I could either use a cable and pulley style system, or a more rigid
          lead screw and motor style system.

          While the lead screw or rigid piston did come with some advantages such as increasing torque naturally and not
          having to worry about cable alignment, it also had tradeoffs. Using the lead screw would pretty much make it
          impossible to use the door handle regularly from the inside. This is why I decided to go with the pulley system.

          For my MVP, I printed a housing for the device to minimize visible wiring and allow for a lot of the action to be
          “behind the scenes.” At this stage, I still was using both a 5V source and a 12V source independently. I also added
          two inputs as my networking had not been done yet. I added a do not disturb switch which closes the door and
          prevents any additional movement and a bathroom button which holds the door open for 15 mins while you use the
          bathroom. At this point, everything was still connected on a breadboard.

      <!-- Solder / iteration paragraph -->
      <section class="section">
        <p class="section-body">
          So, the next steps included adding a buc converter to make it so I only needed a single 12V source which were later
          split between 12V and 5V. Next I put all the components onto a soldered breadboard to more securely form the
          connections. Finally I implemented the networking. In my eyes, the device was pretty much done. However, I didn’t
          realize that the next part would be challenging: attaching it to my door. Now in the initial image, you can see
          that there is an emergency exit poster on the door. This makes two screw holes that I can use if I remove the
          poster! Easy! However, I unfortunately did not do adequate testing up to this point and found out that my device
          did not have enough torque to open the door. To fix this problem, I designed a timing-belt gear system. This added
          a bunch of torque and centered the enclosure to decrease the chance of it falling off the door. This thankfully
          worked and has been unlocking and locking my door ever since!

          I want to thank all of the PS70 staff and my classmates. Without their help this wouldn’t have been possible and I
          love that I was able to get this project that I had been thinking about for years complete. Thank you all!!!

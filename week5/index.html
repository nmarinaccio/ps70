        <p class="section-body">
          This week, we focused on 3d modeling and design. We practiced turning sketches into parametric parts,
          exporting printable geometry, and thinking about tolerances, orientation, supports, and infill. We also
          touched on scanning an object and cleaning the mesh for possible remixing.

      <!-- Hocanopoly Board Game Pieces -->

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Hocanopoly Board Game Pieces</h3>
        <p class="section-body">
          Last year, while I was hiking with some friends from the Harvard Outing Club (HOC), we had the idea to make a HOC themed monopoly. I spent time at the SEC laser cutting, painting, and printing the cards for the game. It worked extremely well and was a ton of fun. We played many times, but something was missing: the pieces. I have been wanting to make custom pieces for the game for quite some time. I decided to make 4 pieces. The first is an outhouse. At our cabin, we have a notoriously interesting outhouse, so I wanted to make a small model of that. Second, I wanted to create a nalgene waterbottle. HOC is also known internally for its “icing” bits using smirnoff ice, so I desinged an ice bottle. Finally, as it is the internal symbol of HOC, I needed to model our wedge of power. I think they turned out really well and were loved by everyone who has played the game since.

      <!-- 3D Scanning -->

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">3d Scanning</h3>
        <p class="section-body">
          The next part of this assignment was the 3d scan something. I had a ton of difficulty with this. I tried my own 3d prints, other random items, and finally the example model. It took quite some time to find an object that worked. I believe that my prints were too small and that the watch I tried was too reflective. After trying mutlple settings and even the wrong program, I was able to get this scan.
